Tech requirements: 

Use React and a GraphQL server to create a movie db web application.

The server should fetch movie data from https://developers.themoviedb.org (no need to persist the data)

Product requirements:

1. The main page should contain a list of the popular movies and a search bar.

2. If you search for a movie in the search bar you should see a list of the movies whose title matches your search.

3. If you click on a movie it should take you to a page where you see more information about that movie.

When you're done, host it on Github and send me a link to it. You shouldn't need to spend more than a few hours on this. If the software looks good, we'll pair-program on this as the next interview round (the more important part).
